I had a dream, I got everything I wanted. Not what you'd think and if I'm being honest it might've been a nightmare to anyone who might care. Thought I could fly (fly) so I stepped off the golden. Nobody cried, Nobody even noticed. I saw them standing right there, kinda thought they might care (might care, might care). I had a dream, I got everything I wanted but when I wake up, I see you with me and you say, "As long as I'm here no one can hurt you. Don't wanna lie here but you can learn to. If I could change the way that you see yourself. You wouldn't wonder why you're here. They don't deserve you". I tried to scream but my head was underwater. They called me weak like I'm not just somebody's daughter. It could've been a nightmare but it felt like someone might care.
